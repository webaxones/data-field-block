Custom plugin designed for my own use and based on the work of:  
  
[Phi Phan](https://github.com/Mr2P)  
[igmoweb](https://github.com/igmoweb)  
[petitphp](https://github.com/petitphp/woocommerce-product-attributes-block)  
  
Adds a block called "Data" which allows me to display: 
- a meta field
- an ACF
- a list of taxonomy terms
- a WooCommerce attribute
- a "Magic" field which returns the result of a filter  
  
There are parameters to customize the render (HTML tag, align) and a hook allows to filter the content.  
  
You can fork this repo if you are a developer, but if you want something maintained, use the following extensions instead:
